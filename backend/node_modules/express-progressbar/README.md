# Node Progress Bar
A simple NodeJs module for sending progress from the server to the client.

## Documentation
*express-progressbar* has two modes:
	- [**Handler mode**](#handler-mode): Handles everything: the request and the progress.
	- [**Request mode**](#request-mode): Allows for more flexibility.

### Handler mode
**Requires Express**

First you need to import the *Handler* object from *express-progressbar*. This handles setting up the server side page and clientside API.

The imported *Handler* object is a function, so you need to call it. It requires the following arguments:

- **progressFunction**: This function handles sending and stopping the progress. Its argument is a class:
	- **update**: The function sends a message to the client.
	- **end**: Closes the connection.
	**You can also send more data into these functions as a second argument.**
- **fileLocation**: The path of the file that handles the client side progress event. *Handler* automatically creates a server get handler for this file.
- **url**: The URL that the user has to type into the address bar. This is the same as you would put into `app.get`
- **app**: The *Express* function
- **progressLocation**: The location that you have to go to to receive the progress values. Defaults to *progress*.

You can also pass *fs*, and *path* (in that order) after the required arguments.

The request and response attributes are also available as the second and third arguments in the *progressFunction*.


The client file can now require *express-progressbar* like this:
```JavaScript
const { Handler } = require('express-progressbar');

Handler(p => {
	let i = 0;

	const int = setInterval(() => {
		if (i > 10) {
			p.close();
			clearInterval(int);
		} else {
			p.update(i / 10 * 100, {
				isCool: true
			});
			i++;
		}
	}, 1000);
}, __dirname + '/index.html', '*', app, 'WebURL' /*, fs, path*/);
```

The passed object is a function that gets called when the server sends a progress event. This function also returns the EventSource.

### Request mode
First you need to import the *Progress* object from *express-progressbar*. This is only the *Progress* class. You need to setup the code on the client-side your self (you can take a look at the example on how to do that).

The *Progress* constructor's only argument is the response object.
The *Progress* class has the following functions:
- **update** Synonym for *sendProgress*
- **end/close**: Synonym for *closeConnection*
- **sendProgress**: ([Number] percentage, [Object] moreData)
- **closeConnection**: ([Object] moreData)
- **constructSSE**: ([Express response object] response, [String] id, [String] data) - This function is not necessary to use.

The client file can now require *express-progressbar* like this:
```JavaScript
const { Progress } = require('express-progressbar');

app.get('/progress', (request, response) => {
	const p = new Progress(response);

	let i = 0;
	const int = setInterval(() => {
		if (i > 10) {
			p.close();
			clearInterval(int);
		} else {
			p.update(i / 10 * 100, {
				isCool: true
			});

			i++;
		}
	}, 1000);
});
```
